      I'm a master's student at the <strong>University of Auckland</strong>, specializing in
      <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>. My interests lie in
      <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>,
      <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>, and
      <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, with a particular focus on AI architecture and system design.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      I have hands-on experience in both academic research and real-world applications, having contributed to
      AI projects in <strong>multimodal content tagging</strong>,
      <strong>intelligent dialogue systems</strong>, and
      <strong>storybook generation</strong>. My technical stack includes
      <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>PyTorch</strong>, <strong>TensorFlow</strong>,
      <strong>LLMs</strong>, <strong>GNNs</strong>, and <strong>RAG or MultiAgent</strong> systems.
