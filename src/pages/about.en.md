## Hi, I‚Äôm Boyu(Yarrow) Ren üëã [‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](/about)

I'm a master's student at the **University of Auckland**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**. My interests lie in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Machine Learning**, with a particular focus on AI architecture and system design.

I have hands-on experience in both academic research and real-world applications, having contributed to AI projects in **multimodal content tagging**, **intelligent dialogue systems**, and **storybook generation**. My technical stack includes **Python**, **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **LLMs**, **GNNs**, and **RAG or MultiAgent** systems.
